# Project Title

## Overview
This project automates the workflow of downloading videos of Highest Available Resolution, storing metadata, and optionally uploading them to Google Drive. It performs the following steps:

Downloads a video and returns its local file path.

Validates and updates spreadsheet headers as needed.

Appends metadata (title, source, date, etc.) to a Google Sheet.

If UPLOAD_TO_DRIVE is enabled, uploads the video to Google Drive and records the file ID in the sheet.

If not, stores the local file path in the sheet instead.

Includes robust error handling for each step.

Ideal for organizing and managing large batches of videos efficiently.
